# My Personal Project

## Music Player

- **What will the application do?**
  - The application will allow users to shuffle or play certain songs, add and remove songs from a queue, and to skip or go back a song
- **Who will use it?**
  - The application' intended audience is young people who are interested in listening to music and curating a set list of music in a queue
- **Why is this project of interest to you?**
  - This project is of interest to me because I love listen to music that matches my mood or current state of mind every minute of the day, therefore being able to create a set list of songs that I can add to on the go is very important to me. Most music streaming platforms seal this feature behind a paywall, so I'm interested in creating a program that can perform the same operations as a regular music streaming platform.
